## Off-line Algorithm formulation
We will define this algorithm for a general number of elevators when we already have all the calls in advance(source, destination and time of the call) and the starting place of all the elevators, we will go over all the possibilities of assigning an elevator to a call by calculating the time it will take for each elevator to get to the source call and then to its destination, finally returning the minimum time it will take for an elevator to perform the whole operation.
